The project consists of designing an image capture system using programmable logic technology (FPGA).

The MT9v111 is used as the image sensor, an Artix-7 FPGA from Xilinx as the controller, USB communication through an FT245-based converter, and software written in C# as the user interface.

Additionally, the system is capable of performing face detection of individuals positioned in front of the camera.
